Lombok is a Java library that helps to reduce boilerplate code by generating getters, setters, constructors, and other utility methods using annotations. Here is a list of some common Lombok annotations along with their brief descriptions:

1. `@Getter`: Generates a getter method for the annotated field.
2. `@Setter`: Generates a setter method for the annotated field.
3. `@ToString`: Generates a `toString()` method for the class based on the fields.
4. `@EqualsAndHashCode`: Generates `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods for the class based on the fields.
5. `@NoArgsConstructor`: Generates a no-argument constructor for the class.
6. `@AllArgsConstructor`: Generates an all-arguments constructor for the class, where each argument corresponds to a field in the class.
7. `@RequiredArgsConstructor`: Generates a constructor for the class with required arguments only. Fields marked with `final` or annotated with `@NonNull` are considered required.
8. `@Data`: A shortcut annotation that combines `@Getter`, `@Setter`, `@ToString`, `@EqualsAndHashCode`, and `@RequiredArgsConstructor`.
9. `@Builder`: Generates a builder pattern implementation for the class, allowing you to create instances using a fluent API.
10. `@SneakyThrows`: Allows you to throw checked exceptions without explicitly declaring them in the method's `throws` clause.
11. `@Value`: A shortcut annotation that combines `@Getter`, `@ToString`, `@EqualsAndHashCode`, `@AllArgsConstructor`, and makes all fields `final`. Useful for creating immutable value classes.
12. `@NoArgsConstructor(force = true)`: Generates a no-argument constructor for the class, setting all fields to their default values (even for `final` fields).
13. `@NonNull`: An annotation used on a field or method parameter to indicate that null values are not allowed. When used with `@RequiredArgsConstructor`, a null-check is added to the constructor.
14. `@Cleanup`: Ensures that the resource (like `InputStream`, `OutputStream`, `Reader`, or `Writer`) is closed after it is used, even if an exception is thrown.
15. `@Delegate`: Automatically delegates method calls from the annotated field to the field's type.
16. `@With`: Generates "with" methods for the annotated field. A "with" method is like a setter, but it returns a new instance of the class with the new field value, rather than modifying the current instance.
